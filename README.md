# Artificial Intelligence-Driven Detection of Genetic Mutations in Glioblastoma Multiforme Using Genomic Data
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to identify specific genetic mutations in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a common and aggressive brain cancer, by analyzing genomic data.

This is the Science Fair project that I will be submitting to my regional, state, and international competitions (if I get there lol).
